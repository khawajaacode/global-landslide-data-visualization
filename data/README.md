# Data Directory

This directory contains the raw and processed data files.

Note: The raw dataset file (`landslides.csv`) is not included in the repository due to its size. 
You can download it from [NASA's Open Data Portal](https://data.nasa.gov/Earth-Science/Global-Landslide-Data-Export-Visual-Explorer/angv-aquq).
